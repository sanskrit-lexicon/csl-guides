# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Featured deep page for **NMMB** (*Nāmamālikā* of Bhoja, Deccan College 1955) — live on CDSL since June 2026; wired into the catalog's guide links and the Featured sidebar
- Featured deep page for **PWKVN** (Böhtlingk's own *Nachträge und Verbesserungen* appendixes to PW, ~25k records; experimental display only)
- July 2026 newsletter: NMMB live, PWKVN digitized, `master`→`main` rename, SKD Sāyaṇa fix

### Changed
- All `sanskrit-lexicon` GitHub links updated `master`→`main` after the org-wide default-branch rename (only `Cologne-Sanskrit-Tamil` keeps `master`); catalog and abbreviations datasets regenerated
- Dictionary count boilerplate bumped 42 → 43 (44 catalog rows incl. the sample-only PD)

### Fixed
- `build-catalog.mjs` no longer hardcodes the `/2020/web/` display path — the web-app year is derived from each row's href (NMMB lives under `/2026/web/`, so its links 404'd)
